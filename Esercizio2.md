# Exercise - Spring Boot - First API 2
* write a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies that has:
    * a `FactorialController` where you map `factorial` in order to:
        * reply with the factorial of the `n` path variable passed with the `GET` request
        * reply with your reversed name (e.g. from `John` to `nhoJ`, using `StringBuilder`) to a `POST` request
* test the API endpoint with `Postman`, executing a `GET` request
* **note for reviewers**: view `FirstApi1.postman_collection.json` in the root folder for the `Postman` calls
